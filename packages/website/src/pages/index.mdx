Welcome to my small, personal corner of the Internet. Click around and make
yourself at home. To make the most of this visit, I would recommend checking out
[some stuff I've written](/writings) and my [interactive résumé](/resume).

If things look a little different around here since you last visited, that's
because I'm involved in the Sisyphean task of redesigning this site
[over](https://portfolio-vjs.dhruvkb-dev.vercel.app) and
[over](https://portfolio-spa.dhruvkb-dev.vercel.app) and
[over](https://portfolio-brut.dhruvkb-dev.vercel.app) and
[over](https://portfolio-mono.dhruvkb-dev.vercel.app),
repeatedly. For more info about this particular iteration, check out the
[colophon](/colophon).

If there's anything more you'd like to know, just ask!

## Contact

If you have a new and interesting idea that I could collaborate on, or want to
ask a question that I might be able to answer, or simply want to talk, you
should drop by and say hi!
