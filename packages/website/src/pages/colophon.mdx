# Colophon

I designed and built this site myself. As with my other projects, this site is
free/_libre_, free/_gratis_ and open-source software, with the
[source code](https://github.com/dhruvkb/portfolio) available on GitHub to use
as you like. Except steal and claim as your own, because that would not be a
nice thing to do.

Apart from this colophon, you might also find interesting [writing](/writings)
related to this site under the "portfolio" tag.

## Ideology

This site subscribes to many [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) tenets such as
data and domain ownership, open-source tools and longevity of plain text files.
I plan on integrating more IndieWeb technologies such as
[RelMeAuth](https://indieweb.org/RelMeAuth) and
[Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) in the future.

## Design

### Colors

The site's color palette comes from [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/),
specifically the Mocha and Latte variants for the dark and light modes
respectively. Earlier iterations of the site have used
[Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and
[Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), both of which are also excellent color
palettes.

### Typography

The site uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson, as the
sans-serif typeface. Inter is famously readable at all sizes and weights, for
both headings and body text. The résume, for a more classical look, uses the
serif typeface [Spectral](https://productiontype.com/font/spectral) by
Production Type. Both fonts are open-source and licensed under the SIL Open Font
License 1.1.

The programming typeface is set to `monospace` for a multitude of reasons:
- This respects the font choices of the user. Programmers are very particular
  about their typefaces, and letting them read in their preferred font makes for
  a good experience.
- Not having to download a font makes the site faster and more efficient, and
  avoids the flash of unstyled text.

Unfortunately, users of Safari will probably not have a choice in fonts, so they
will have to exercise their choice in web browsers.

## Technology

For a developer portfolio, I find it ironic that this is a collection of largely
static pages.

- The site is built on the concept of progressive enhancement and can be used
  without both CSS and JavaScript, with little or no degradation in the overall
  experience.
- The source code is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
  [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), because
  JS should be strongly typed, HTML should be broken into components and CSS
  should be tokenized.
- Open Graph images (_e.g._ [this one](/og/colophon.png)) are generated with
  [`@vercel/og`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/og). Automation is great
  for tasks like this that are otherwise impossible to do manually with
  consistency.
- [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com) provides privacy-friendly metrics
  without adding too much bloat. Data is only retained for 31 days. You can opt
  out by disabling JavaScript in your browser.
- My [interactive résumé](/resume/) and some other parts of the site generated
  from a JSON file using [Récivi](https://recivi.vercel.app), a personal
  endeavour to create a new kind of résumé for computers.
- The only external requests this site makes are to
  [Rasmus' site](https://rsms.me) for Inter,
  [Goat Counter](https://goatcounter.com) for analytics and
  [Google Fonts](https://) for Spectral (only on the résumé PDF page).

{/* TODO: Add link to Récivi JSON file. */}
