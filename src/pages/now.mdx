# Now

These are all the things I am currently involved in spanning a few days in the
past, and the foreseeable future.

## Working

- As a team lead, software engineer and open-source maintainer on
  [Openverse](https://openverse.org/), a search engine for
  openly-licensed media. It is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) project
  that indexes audio and images that have either permissive Creative Commons
  licenses or are in the public domain and makes them freely accessible.

## Building

- [`pls`](https://pls.cli.rs), a prettier and powerful `ls(1)` for the pros. I
  learn by building stuff and this is something I'm building to learn Rust.
- [Récivi](https://recivi.vercel.app), a new type of résumé that is targeted at
  computers first and can be converted to any human format when needed. It's
  what powers this website.
- My personal website which is what you're reading night now. Maintaining this
  website and building it further is both fun and challenging.

## Learning

- How to lead a team. I'm faily new to the leadership thing and I want to do a
  really good job of representing my team. Thankfully I have coaching and
  training sessions to help.
- Rust, a fantastic language, with so many good decisions, that absolutely
  deserves the love it gets from the dev community. I am learning Rust by
  building a CLI app [`pls`](https://pls.cli.rs) with it.
- To use the terminal more and more, and use the mouse as infrequently as
  possible. To that end I'm incorporating new CLI tools into my work, trying to
  use a terminal editor, and creating and memorising keymaps.
- To write more. I want to improve my writing and cultivate a habit of jotting
  down notes and interesting observations. That'll go on my blog.

## Writing

- [Posts](/writings) on my site! Give them a read and see if you like them!
  Also, please [let me know](/) if you do, I would appreciate the dopamine hit.
