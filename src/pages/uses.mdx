# Uses

I don't really know who would take any interest in what tools I use, but here
they are. I'll try to keep this list updated as my workflow changes.

Do not consider my usage of any of these things as a recommendation. Your
circumstances, budget and needs will likely be different and these may not be
the best options for you. Also, none of the links here are affiliate links.

## Furniture

For my desk and chair, I had a combined budget of 2k USD.

- **Desk:** I went with the
  [IKEA Idåsen](https://www.ikea.com/ae/en/p/idasen-desk-sit-stand-black-dark-grey-s89280993/)
  sit/stand desk because it was easily available in Dubai, had an excellent 10
  year warranty and fit neatly under my budget. I use
  [Linak controller](https://github.com/rhyst/linak-controller) to move the desk
  using Raycast scripts.

- **Chair:** After a lot of deliberation, I chose the remastered
  [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chair/)
  chair because it had glorious reviews as one of the finest ergonomic chairs.
  If I could do over, I'd probably go with the Herman Miller Embody chair.

- **Organisation:** For organising my workspace, I set up an
  [IKEA Skådis](https://www.ikea.com/ae/en/p/skadis-pegboard-white-10321618/)
  pegboard and accessories on the edge of the desk itself. I also added an
  [IKEA Idåsen drawer unit](https://www.ikea.com/ae/en/p/idasen-drawer-unit-with-smart-lock-dark-grey-s19287276/)
  to go under the desk.

- **Lighting:** I have an
  [IKEA Tertial](https://www.ikea.com/ae/en/p/tertial-work-lamp-dark-grey-40450802/)
  lamp mounted to an edge of the desk. It makes for excellent focused lighting
  when it's dark, and I can rotate it backwards to use as soft wall lighting
  when needed.

I'll share a picture once my desk's cleaned up. Don't hold your breath though,
it could take quite a while to make the desk look good.

## Hardware

- **Computer:**
  - For my primary computer, I use an
    [Apple MacBook Pro 16", M2 Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Pro-16-M2)
    from 2023. It's a powerhouse when I need power and also has great battery
    life when I don't.
  - I've previously driven a ThinkPad X220 with some upgraded parts, like an
    after-market SSD. It works great and I still go back to it when I need a
    Linux machine.

- **Mouse:** I use a
  [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006557.html)
  as my mouse. It's got a lot of buttons, all of them customisable, which I've
  set up to do appropriate things in different applications. It's also fairly
  ergonomic so it's great for prolonged use.

- **Keyboard:** As I was just getting into the world of mechanical keyboards, I
  got myself a
  [Keychron K2 v2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)
  with Brown switches. It's been great but now the keycaps are wearing out and
  the battery doesn't last very long so I'm on the lookout for a replacement.

- **Webcam:** I use my
  [Apple iPhone 13 Pro](https://www.apple.com/ae/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-13-pro)
  as my webcam using the Continuity Camera feature. With that I can record great
  video, that any regular webcam cannot match.

- **Audio:** I use
  [Apple AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) as my primary mic
  and headphones. They're great for calls, have good features like spatial audio
  with head-tracking, and can actively cancel noise or become transparent.

## Software

While I would love to only use free/_libre_, free/_gratis_ and open-source
software exclusively, it's not practical and I have to use some proprietary
software to get work done.

- **Operating system:** On my MacBook, I don't really have a choice but to use
  [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia/). I'm usually always on
  the latest available version. On my ThinkPad, I use
  [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), also usually the latest version.

- **Package manager:** I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage my installed
  software, including GUI applications using Casks. It makes it easy to install
  all the software I need setting up a fresh machine and also keep them updated.

- **Terminal app:** I use [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) as my main terminal.
  After using iTerm2 for the longest time, I wanted to use a terminal that had
  better performance, support for Kitty graphics and a text-based config.
  Ghostty narrowly beat out WezTerm.

- **IDE/Editor:**
  - I now use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because JetBrains IDEs
    were being buggy, moving slowly and lagging in features. I also feel better
    about using an open-source editor.
  - In the terminal, I use [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) as my `$EDITOR`.
    It feels like the spiritual successor to `vim` but with a few key better
    design choices.

- **Font:**
  - I use [GitHub Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) as my main
    programming font. In most places, I have set up a fallback to
    [Symbols Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for extra icon
    goodness.
  - I have previously used Nerd Font's patched version of JetBrains Mono. It's
    also a great font family, but I felt like it had become unmaintained and
    was slowly going stale.

- **Browser:**
  - I currently use [Arc](https://arc.net/) as my main browser. The concepts of
    spaces, profiles and ephemeral tabs it introduced were a paradigm shift for
    me and now these features have become integral to my workflow.
  - I am simultaneously using [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/), albeit in an
    experimental capacity. Orion can become my main browser if it gets more
    stable and polished by the time the folks at The Browser Company kill Arc.

- **Launcher:** I use [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) to launch apps, control my
  desk, manage window placements and more. I have not purchased a subscription,
  mainly because I don't use any of their new AI features.

- **Music:** I am a captive of the Apple ecosystem so I use
  [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) for my music. Subscribing to
  the service prevents having to manually organise my music collection, which
  used to take up huge amounts of my time before.

- **Note-taking:** [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- **API client:** [Bruno](https://usebruno.com/)
- **Container system:** [OrbStack](https://orbstack.com/)

- **Theme:** I am a huge sucker for consistency so I use
  [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) everywhere as it has ports for every
  piece of software, including Ghostty, VS Code and Obsidian. You might have
  noticed that this site is also using the Catppuccin theme.

As you can probably expect, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dhruvkb/dotfiles)
are open-source. You can use them directly, or as a jumping-off point to craft
your own. I also have a post on
[how I set up a new computer](writings/posts/setting_up_a_new_computer) by
using these dotfiles.

## Services

- **Code hosting:** I use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host my code. While I
  would prefer to use a free software alternative, GitHub has a stronger network
  and the unlimited features in the free personal tier are too good to pass up.

- **Domain:** I had purchased this domain from Google Domains. When they decided
  to close down and sell everything to Squarespace, I migrated the domain over
  to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) and have not looked back.
  [This page](https://porkbun.com/awesome) might convince you to do the same.

- **Hosting:**
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
  - [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

### Python development

- **Tool manager:** I use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the Python
  tools I have installed, which ironically includes other Python package
  managers and the Linak controller, which I use to control my sit/stand desk.

- **Package manager:** Many of my Python projects use
  [PDM](https://pdm-project.org) as the package manager, largely because the
  best option, uv wasn't production ready. PDM is also awesome and doesn't offer
  much to complain about.

### JavaScript development

- **Node manager:** I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage my Node.js
  versions. There were other options too, but I specifically chose nvm because of
  familiarity and my aversion to changing what just works well.

- **Package manager:** I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as my package manager for
  JavaScript projects. I tried pnpm once and was immediately blown away by its speed. I
  have not used npm since and even convinced a few people to switch to pnpm.
