        I <strong>write code</strong> as a hobby and also as a full-time job. Getting paid to do what
        I love feels pretty awesome.

        All the code I write for myself, and most of what I write at work, is
        <strong>open-source</strong>. You can see all of it on

        For over half my life, I've worked on <strong>all aspects</strong> of software development,
        from planning to deployment, from backend to frontend, and everything in between. I've even
        dabbled a little bit in UX/UI design.

          class="align-top"

        Judge for yourself, I designed this site.
